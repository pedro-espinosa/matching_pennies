# matching_pennies
This is a programme that enables participants to play a game of matching pennies against the computer. If both pennies match, the participant gets a point, if they don't match the computer gets a point. The experimenter can specify whether the computer chooses randomly (default), it is biased to a particular face, or follows a strategy of switching from its own past decisions or the participants past decisions. Additionally, the programme automatically prints some results at the end of the game namely:
  - Final score
  - How often the subject switched their choice so that it was different from their choice in the previous round
  - How often the subject switched their choice so that it was different from the computerâ€™s
  choice in the previous round.)


Experimenter controls:
Computer's bias for heads.
Computer's strategy based on own past decisions.
Computer's strategy based on opponent's decisions.
Computer's strategy based on past results.

The programme asks the experimenter for subject ID and stores the data in the experiments csv file.
